\section{Exercise 4}

In this exercise we have a couple of assignment that have to be done. The web app used for plotting is found at \url{https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~herme107/viscol/}.

\subsection{4.a$)$}

Here we had to make code that tiled the space whit spheres in a cubic lattice formation. The code for the generation of this lattice is found in Appendix~\ref{app:E4.a}.

On the web app for plotting this lattice, Figure~\ref{fig: cubic lattice} was made using the file that was generated.

	\label{fig: cubic lattice}
\end{figure}



\subsection{4.b$)$}
We want to know the maximum packing density for spheres in a cubic lattice.



\subsection{4.c$)$}
Here we had to make code that tiled a space with spheres in a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. The code for the generation of this lattice is found in Appendix~\ref{app:E4.b}.

On the web app for plotting this lattice, Figure~\ref{fig: Fcc lattice} was made using the file that was generated.
